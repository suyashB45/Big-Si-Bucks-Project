To perform k-nearest neighbors (KNN) analysis using the auto-mobile pricing dataset from Kaggle and visualize it using scatter plots, histograms, and heatmaps, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Download and Load the Dataset
First, download the dataset from Kaggle. You can find it [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kiran1995/auto-mobile-pricing/code). Load the dataset into your Python environment using pandas:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Replace 'path_to_dataset' with the actual path where you saved the dataset
df = pd.read_csv('path_to_dataset/auto-mobile-pricing.csv')
```

### Step 2: Preprocess the Data (if necessary)
Inspect the dataset to understand its structure and perform any necessary preprocessing steps such as handling missing values or encoding categorical variables.

### Step 3: Perform KNN Analysis
For demonstration, let's assume you want to predict auto-mobile pricing using KNN based on some features (`column_a` to `column_z`). You would typically select relevant features and the target variable (`price` in this case).

```python
from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsRegressor
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

# Assuming 'column_a' to 'column_z' are features and 'price' is the target variable
X = df[['column_a', 'column_b', ..., 'column_z']]
y = df['price']

# Split data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Standardize the features
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test)

# Initialize the KNN regressor
knn = KNeighborsRegressor(n_neighbors=5)  # You can adjust n_neighbors as needed

# Fit the model
knn.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train)

# Predict on the test set
y_pred = knn.predict(X_test_scaled)

# Calculate Mean Squared Error (MSE) as a metric
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
print(f'Mean Squared Error: {mse}')
```

### Step 4: Visualize Results
#### Scatter Plot
Visualize the relationship between predicted and actual prices using a scatter plot:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
plt.scatter(y_test, y_pred)
plt.xlabel('Actual Prices')
plt.ylabel('Predicted Prices')
plt.title('Actual Prices vs Predicted Prices')
plt.show()
```

#### Histogram
Visualize the distribution of errors (residuals) using a histogram:

```python
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
plt.hist(y_test - y_pred, bins=30)
plt.xlabel('Error')
plt.ylabel('Frequency')
plt.title('Distribution of Errors')
plt.show()
```

#### Heatmap
If you want to visualize the correlation matrix of the features:

```python
import seaborn as sns

correlation_matrix = X.corr()
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 10))
sns.heatmap(correlation_matrix, annot=True, cmap='coolwarm', fmt='.2f', linewidths=.5)
plt.title('Correlation Matrix')
plt.show()
```

### Notes:
- Replace `'column_a'` to `'column_z'` with actual column names from your dataset.
- Adjust parameters and visualizations as per your specific requirements.
- Ensure you have matplotlib, seaborn, pandas, and scikit-learn (`sklearn`) installed in your Python environment.

These steps should guide you through performing KNN analysis on the auto-mobile pricing dataset and visualizing the results using scatter plots, histograms, and heatmaps. Adjustments may be needed based on the specifics of your dataset and analysis goals.
