# Automobile Dataset Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains an analysis of the automobile dataset, which includes various features of cars such as make, model, fuel type, engine size, and more. The purpose of this analysis is to explore the dataset, clean the data, and perform statistical analysis to gain insights into the automobile industry.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this analysis is `imports_85_data.csv`, which contains information about various car models. Below is a brief description of the columns in the dataset:
