# YOLOv8 Football Dataset

This repository provides the necessary files and instructions to train a YOLOv8 model using a football dataset available on Kaggle. The dataset contains images annotated in YOLO format and is intended for educational and learning purposes.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset includes images annotated with two classes:
- `0` - Player
- `1` - Football

You can find and download the dataset from Kaggle using the following link: [Football YOLOv8 Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/outliersloop/footballyolov8/data)



## YOLO Format

Each image has a corresponding `.txt` file in the `labels` directory with the same name as the image file. Each line in the `.txt` file represents one object and contains:
- Class ID (0 for player, 1 for football)
- x_center (normalized)
- y_center (normalized)
- width (normalized)
- height (normalized)

Example of a label file:
```
0 0.5 0.5 0.1 0.2
1 0.6 0.6 0.05 0.05
```

## Training YOLOv8

To train a YOLOv8 model on this dataset, follow these steps:

1. **Download the dataset from Kaggle:**
   [Football YOLOv8 Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/outliersloop/footballyolov8/data)
   Extract the downloaded files and organize them into the `data/images` and `data/labels` directories as specified.


2. **Install YOLOv8 dependencies:**
   Follow the [YOLOv8 installation instructions](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov8).

3. **Train the model:**
   ```bash
   yolo train data=yolov8_config.yaml model=yolov8s.pt epochs=100 imgsz=640
   ```

## Configuration File

The `yolov8_config.yaml` file specifies the paths to the training and validation data:

```yaml
train: data/images/train
val: data/images/val

nc: 2
names: ['player', 'football']
```

## Predictions

After training, you can use the trained model to make predictions on new images:

```bash
yolo predict model=runs/train/exp/weights/best.pt source=data/images/val
```

This will output the prediction results for the validation images.
