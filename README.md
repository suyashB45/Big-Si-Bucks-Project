## Linear Regression

Linear regression is a fundamental machine learning algorithm used for predicting a continuous dependent variable based on one or more independent variables. In this project, we implement linear regression to understand the relationship between different variables and make predictions.

### Features
- Simple implementation of linear regression
- Visualization of the regression line
- Evaluation metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE)

## Classification of MNIST Dataset using KNN

The MNIST dataset is a classic dataset in the field of machine learning and computer vision. It consists of 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9). In this project, we classify the digits using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm.

### Features
- Preprocessing and normalization of the MNIST dataset
- Implementation of the KNN algorithm for classification
- Evaluation using accuracy metrics

## YOLO Object Detection

YOLO (You Only Look Once) is a state-of-the-art, real-time object detection system. It can detect multiple objects in an image with high accuracy. This project demonstrates the simplest version of YOLO to detect objects in images.

### Features
- Simplified implementation of YOLO for object detection
- Pre-trained model to detect common objects
- Visualization of detected objects with bounding boxes

## Sentiment Analysis

Sentiment analysis is a natural language processing (NLP) technique used to determine the sentiment expressed in text data. This project aims to classify text data as positive, negative, or neutral using a machine learning algorithm.

### Features
- Text preprocessing and tokenization
- Implementation of a sentiment analysis algorithm
- Evaluation using precision, recall, and F1-score

## Installation

To run these projects, you need to have Python installed on your system. Additionally, install the required libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Each project is contained in its respective directory. To run a specific project, navigate to the directory and follow the instructions provided in the README file within that directory.

Example:

```bash
cd linear_regression
python linear_regression.py
```
